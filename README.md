### A neutral replicated state machine


Join the network with a [validator node](https://github.com/OLSF/libra/wiki/Onboarding-process-for-validators), to secure the chain.

Run a [fullnode](https://github.com/OLSF/libra/wiki/Mining-VDF-Proofs), to keep a copy of the state machine.

Contribute to [issues](https://github.com/OLSF/libra/issues).
